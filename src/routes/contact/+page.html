Alright, let's tackle this user request. They want a card component, and they have specific instructions on how to format the code using Semantq custom tags. First, I need to make sure I understand all the requirements clearly.

The user mentioned writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the card. They want each part wrapped in specific custom tags: @html, @style, and @script. Also, the HTML section shouldn't have an @end tag, and the final output should only include the HTML code without any explanations. 

Let me start by breaking down the components. The card should have an image, a title, some text, and a button. Maybe a hover effect for interactivity. For CSS, I'll need to style the card with some padding, shadows, and maybe a transition for the hover. The JavaScript could handle a click event on the button.

Wait, the user specified to return only the HTML code. But they also want the CSS and JS wrapped in their respective tags. However, the final answer should only include the HTML part. Hmm, maybe I need to include all three sections within the HTML using the custom tags. Let me check the instructions again.

Yes, the user wants the JavaScript in @script tags, CSS in @style, and HTML in @html. But the final output should only return the HTML code. Oh, wait, no. The user said, "Return only the HTML code, without any additional explanation." So perhaps the HTML section includes the CSS and JS via the custom tags. That makes sense because in a real project, you might include CSS and JS within the HTML file.

So the structure would be:

@html
<!-- HTML code here -->
@style
/* CSS code here */
@end
@script
// JS code here
@end

But the user said not to include an @end tag for the HTML section. Wait, the instruction says: "- Do not include an @end tag for the HTML section." So the HTML starts with @html and doesn't have an @end, while the CSS and JS do.

Putting it all together, the HTML block will contain the @style and @script sections within it, each with their own @end tags. The final output should be just the HTML part, which includes the CSS and JS via the custom tags.

So, the HTML code will have the structure of the card, and within the same HTML file, the CSS and JS are included using the custom tags. That way, when the user uses Semantq, it can parse each section appropriately.

Let me draft the HTML structure first. A div with class 'card', an image container, then content with a title, text, and a button. For CSS, I'll style the card with flexbox, add a box shadow, and transitions. The JavaScript will add a click event listener to the button for an alert.

Wait, the user might want the CSS and JS to be in their respective tags but within the HTML. So in the HTML section, after the card's HTML structure, I include the @style and @script blocks. But according to the instructions, the HTML code is wrapped in @html, and the CSS and JS in their own tags. So the final answer should have @html containing the HTML structure, followed by @style and @script sections, each properly closed with @end. But the HTML section itself doesn't have an @end.

Wait, the user's instructions are a bit conflicting. Let me re-read:

- Wrap the JavaScript code in Semantq custom JS tags: @script //code @end
- Wrap the CSS code in Semantq custom CSS tags: @style /* code */ @end
- Wrap the HTML code in Semantq custom HTML tags: @html <!-- code -->
- Do not include an @end tag for the HTML section.
- Return only the HTML code, without any additional explanation.

So, the HTML code is wrapped in @html, but doesn't have an @end. The CSS and JS are in their own tags with @end. But the user wants only the HTML code returned. So the answer should be the @html section containing the HTML structure, and within that, the CSS and JS are included using their own tags. Wait, no. Because the HTML, CSS, and JS are separate sections. Maybe the user wants three separate blocks, but only the HTML part is to be returned. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the HTML code includes the CSS and JS via the custom tags, but the user wants only the HTML part (i.e., the @html section) without the CSS and JS. But the initial instructions say to include all three but wrap each in their own tags.

This is a bit confusing. Let me clarify.

The user wants:

- The JavaScript code wrapped in @script ... @end
- The CSS wrapped in @style ... @end
- The HTML wrapped in @html ... (no @end)
- The final answer should return only the HTML code, meaning the @html section, but the CSS and JS are in their own tags within the HTML?

No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe the user wants three separate sections, but in the response, only the HTML code (the @html section) is included, without the CSS and JS. But the initial instructions say to include all three.

Wait, the user wrote:

"Return only the HTML code, without any additional explanation."

So, despite having to write CSS and JS, the final answer should only include the HTML part. But how can that be? The user probably wants the HTML code that includes the CSS and JS via the custom tags. So the HTML section includes the @style and @script blocks.

Wait, in normal HTML, you can have <style> and <script> tags. But the user wants to use custom Semantq tags. So perhaps the HTML code includes @style and @script sections, which are then processed by Semantq.

But the user's instruction says to wrap each code type in their respective custom tags. So the HTML code is in @html, CSS in @style, JS in @script. But the answer should return only the HTML code, meaning the @html section. However, the @html section would contain the HTML structure, and within that, perhaps the @style and @script custom tags for the CSS and JS.

Wait, maybe the user wants three separate blocks in the response: the HTML in @html, CSS in @style, JS in @script. But the user says to return only the HTML code. So the answer should be just the @html section without the CSS and JS. But that contradicts the initial instructions.

Alternatively, the user wants the HTML code to include the CSS and JS via Semantq's custom tags, which are then processed elsewhere. So the HTML code would have the structure of the card, and within the HTML file, the CSS and JS are included using @style and @script tags.

For example:

@html
<div class="card">
...
</div>
@style
.card { ... }
@end
@script
document.querySelector(...);
@end

But the user said not to include an @end tag for the HTML section. So the HTML starts with @html and has no @end, while the CSS and JS sections are within the HTML block and have their own @end tags.

But how does that work in practice? Maybe the Semantq processor parses the file, extracts the HTML, CSS, and JS from their respective tags. So the user wants the HTML code (the part inside @html) to include the HTML structure, and then within that same block, include the CSS and JS using their tags. But that's not standard HTML.

Alternatively, the HTML code is just the HTML part, and the CSS and JS are separate, but the user wants them wrapped in their own tags in the response. However, the user specified to return only the HTML code. This is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the user's exact instructions:

- Wrap the JavaScript code in Semantq custom JS tags: @script //code @end
- Wrap the CSS code in Semantq custom CSS tags: @style /* code */ @end
- Wrap the HTML code in Semantq custom HTML tags: @html <!-- code -->
- Do not include an @end tag for the HTML section.
- Return only the HTML code, without any additional explanation.

Ah, so the user wants three separate code blocks in the response, each wrapped in their respective custom tags. But the final answer should only include the HTML code (the @html section), not the CSS and JS. But that contradicts the initial part where they ask to include all three. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I have to follow the instructions as given.

Wait, the user says: "Return only the HTML code, without any additional explanation." So despite writing CSS and JS in their custom tags, the final answer should only have the HTML part. But how? Because the initial instructions say to include all three. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, the user wants the HTML code to include the CSS and JS via the custom tags, but the answer should only show the HTML section. For example, the HTML code includes the Semantq custom tags for CSS and JS within it. So the @html block contains the HTML structure, and within that, the @style and @script blocks with their code.

But in standard HTML, you can't have custom tags like @style, but perhaps Semantq processes them. So the final HTML code would look like:

@html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card__image-container">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" class="card__image" alt="Sample">
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <h3 class="card__title">Card Title</h3>
    <p class="card__text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore.</p>
    <button class="card__button">Learn More</button>
  </div>
</div>

@style
.card {
  /* CSS code */
}
@end

@script
// JS code
@end

But the user said not to include an @end tag for the HTML section. So the HTML starts with @html and has no @end, while the CSS and JS have their own @end tags. However, the user wants only the HTML code returned, which would be the part from @html to the end, including the CSS and JS sections. But that doesn't make sense because the CSS and JS are separate.

This is quite confusing. Maybe the user intended that the HTML code includes the CSS and JS within it using the custom tags, but without the @end for HTML. For example:

@html
<!-- HTML structure here -->
@style
/* CSS code */
@end
@script
// JS code
@end

But without the @end for HTML. So the entire response is the @html section, which contains the HTML, followed by the CSS and JS in their own tags. Since the user said to return only the HTML code, this would be the entire block starting with @html and including the CSS and JS parts within it, but using Semantq's custom tags.

In that case, the answer would be:

@html
<div class="card">
  ...
</div>
@style
.card { ... }
@end
@script
document.querySelector(...);
@end

But without an @end for the HTML. So the HTML section includes the CSS and JS code within their own tags. This way, when processed by Semantq, each part is extracted correctly.

Yes, that makes sense. The user wants the HTML code (the @html section) to include the CSS and JS within it, using their respective custom tags. So the final answer is the @html block containing the HTML structure, followed by the @style and @script blocks, each properly closed with @end. But the HTML section itself doesn't have an @end tag.

So putting it all together, the HTML code would be:

@html
<div class="card">
  <div class="card__image-container">
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300" class="card__image" alt="Sample">
  </div>
  <div class="card__content">
    <h3 class="card__title">Card Title</h3>
    <p class="card__text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore.</p>
    <button class="card__button">Learn More</button>
  </div>
</div>

@style
.card {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  max-width: 300px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  overflow: hidden;
  background: white;
  transition: transform 0.2s;
}
.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
}
.card__image-container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
}
.card__image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  object-fit: cover;
}
.card__content {
  padding: 16px;
}
.card__title {
  margin: 0 0 8px;
  font-size: 1.25rem;
  color: #333;
}
.card__text {
  margin: 0 0 12px;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
.card__button {
  padding: 8px 16px;
  background: #007bff;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: white;
  cursor: pointer;
}
.card__button:hover {
  background: #0056b3;
}
@end

@script
document.querySelector('.card__button').addEventListener('click', () => {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
@end

But since the user specified to return only the HTML code (the @html section), and the CSS and JS are within their own tags inside the HTML block, the final answer is the entire @html section without an @end tag. Wait, no. The user said to wrap each code type in their custom tags. So the HTML is in @html, CSS in @style, JS in @script. But the answer should return only the HTML code, meaning only the @html part. But the user also said to include the CSS and JS in their respective tags. This is conflicting.

Perhaps the user wants all three code blocks in the response, each wrapped in their respective tags, but the final answer should only include the HTML code. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the user wants the HTML code to include the CSS and JS via the custom tags, so the entire answer is the @html block containing the HTML structure, followed by @style and @script sections. But the HTML block doesn't have an @end, while the others do.

In that case, the answer would be as follows, with the @html section containing the HTML, CSS, and JS each in their own tags. But the HTML section doesn't close with @end, while the CSS and JS do. Then, the final answer is the entire @html block, which includes the CSS and JS within it. That way, when processed, each part can be extracted.

So the final answer is:

@html
<!-- HTML structure -->
<div class="card">...</div>

@style
/* CSS code */
@end

@script
// JS code
@end

But without the @end for the HTML. So the HTML section is a single block that includes the CSS and JS sections within it, each properly closed. This meets the user's requirement of wrapping each code type in their respective tags and returning only the HTML code (the @html section) without an @end tag.

Yes, that must be it. The user wants the HTML code to be the @html block, which contains the HTML, followed by the CSS and JS in their own tags. The HTML block doesn't have an @end, but the CSS and JS do. This way, the response is only the HTML part (the @html section), which includes the necessary code for CSS and JS within it using Semantq's custom tags.
