 I have a router that does all that except number 7 - can that e called the router api as well- in our case - developers can use routes this way: 1) file based routes - for any pages created routes are computed automatically, here user can still define resource to be rendered e.g. page or component 2) declared routes - can load either pages or components 3)router also listens to pop state changes e.g. if some types a url on the browser address bar 4) 404 error handling for invalid routes or routes without corresponding resources (page or component) to render 5) dynamic routing eg. user/:id/profile - the id is made available via componentDataId variable 6)routes with search parameters e.g. shop?product=shirt&price=100&size=m 7) search parameters work click event routes where user clicks the link as well as pop state events 

 the router also handles canonicals e.g. https://google.com - also - file based routing supports nested routes e.g. /services/ , services/asia, services/asia/basic, etc
